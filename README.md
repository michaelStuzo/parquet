# Parquet File testing different node.js libraries

## [hyparquet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyparquet)

Couldn't make it work with the latest version of `hyparquet` (v1.14.0) as it always throws

```
Error: No "exports" main defined in /Users/myali/Documents/Code/parquet/node_modules/hyparquet/package.json
```

## [@dsnp/parquetjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsnp/parquetjs)

Is a supportable library based on `parquetjs` and `parquetjs-lite` but with some fixes and improvements.

## [parquetjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parquetjs)
